    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>💫 About Me
I'm a Software Engineering learner at ALX and a Mechatronics Engineering student who enjoys learning through doing — from coding and automation to exploring AI and computer-aided design (CAD).

Before diving fully into software, I spent 4 years managing a cybercafé, where I handled day-to-day operations, customer support, and system maintenance. I also worked as a Virtual Assistant , gaining remote work experience and improving my communication and organizational skills.

Now, my passion lies in building tech-driven solutions, learning continuously, and exploring how AI, automation, and software can shape the future of engineering and defense.</p>
